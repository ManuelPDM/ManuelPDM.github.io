       <h1>Raven's Progressive Matrix Project</h1>
       <p>
         Welcome to one of the coolest projects I’ve built—a deep dive into solving Raven's Progressive Matrices using state-of-the-art image processing and pattern recognition techniques.
       </p>
       <h2>My Journey</h2>
       <p>
         I embarked on this project with the goal of mimicking human cognitive pattern recognition. Using Python and robust libraries like OpenCV, Pillow, and NumPy, I developed an algorithm that not only solves these puzzles but also sheds light on how visual patterns can be deciphered.
       </p>
       <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
       <p>
         Here’s a closer look at the technical side of the project:
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <strong>Grayscale Conversion & Thresholding:</strong> Each input image is first converted to grayscale. Then, by applying thresholding, I create a binary version of the image that emphasizes key contours. This simplifies the puzzle into data that’s easier to analyze.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>Contour Detection & Feature Extraction:</strong> Using OpenCV's contour detection, the algorithm isolates significant shapes in the puzzle. It extracts several geometric features—such as the number of edges, centroid coordinates, contour area, and even orientation using ellipse fitting or minimum area rectangles. These features form the backbone of the pattern recognition process.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>Pattern Comparison Techniques:</strong> The project employs a multi-step comparison process. By overlaying images and computing pixel differences, it captures subtle changes between different parts of the matrix. Techniques like image subtraction, minimum overlays, and even bitwise XOR operations help deduce relationships among the images.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>Decision-Making Logic:</strong> Once the features are extracted and the patterns compared, similarity scores are computed to identify the best match among candidate answers. This blend of geometric analysis and pixel-level comparisons ensures that the solution is both accurate and robust.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
         While the inner workings involve some advanced math and image manipulation, the overall design abstracts these complexities into a streamlined system that’s both innovative and hard to replicate. It’s a testament to combining technical rigor with creative problem-solving.
